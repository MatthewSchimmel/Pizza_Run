PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to complete a midterm assignment
VERSION or DATE: 2.0
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: click 'project'
AUTHORS: Matthew Schimmel
USER INSTRUCTIONS: press the arrow keys or wasd to move. The object of the game is to deliver pizzas from the shop (top left on screen) to the houses.

Patch Notes:
 - condensed code
 - instafail and instawin cheats actually stop the game now
 - fixed exploit allowing the player to move at double speed (ex. by pressing  the "up" and "w" key at the same time)
 - removes instafail screen. probably had been in game just to add filler content
 - when the player wins, the cheat screen is told to the player.
 - when the player is moving on a digonal, the car now appears diagonal.
 - note: The player must activate cheats like on/off invinciblity at the start of every level. Progressing to another level will cancel invincibility status.

To do: add space on the screen, and make houses spawn farther and farther away at higher levels

	Remove instafail and instawin cheats. They provide no actual functions.
	Condense code and update - create constructor with parameter to reduce the number of assests, both player and NPC, in the game
	add truck with two pizza capacity and van with three. Trade-off is speed.
	add acceleration mechanics which allow upgrades to acceleration. conserve momentum and need a little time to break.
	make loss return the player to the first level, possibly after the timer on the lose screen.
	add sounds?
